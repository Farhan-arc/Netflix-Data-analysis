🎬 Netflix Data Analysis Using Python
📊 Uncovering Content Trends & Viewer Insights

📌 Project Overview
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s content dataset, which contains detailed information about thousands of Movies and TV Shows available on the platform.

It includes features such as:

🎥 Title | 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Cast | 🎬 Genre | 🌍 Country | 🕒 Date Added | 📅 Release Year | ⏱ Duration

The goal: Clean, explore, and analyze the data to uncover content trends and answer business-relevant questions around platform content, release patterns, and cast appearances.

🎯 Objectives
🔍 Explore and clean content metadata
📆 Analyze content release trends by year
📺 Compare distributions of Movies vs. TV Shows
👤 Identify frequently appearing actors (e.g., Tom Cruise)
🎭 Understand popular genres and content duration
📈 Generate insights to support content strategy decisions

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
❌ Missing Values: Handled nulls in key columns like Cast, Country, and Director
🔠 Text Normalization: Lowercased and stripped strings for consistent searching
📅 Date Conversion: Transformed date columns for time-based analysis
🧮 Feature Engineering: Extracted Year, Month, Type, Duration metrics

🔍 Key Insights
📆 Release Trends
Identified the year with the highest number of releases
Compared release volume across years

🎭 Content Type Distribution
Visualized the balance between Movies and TV Shows
Analyzed how this trend has changed over time

👤 Cast Analysis
Filtered cast data to check actor frequency
Found the number of movies featuring Tom Cruise

🎬 Genre & Duration
Studied the top genres on Netflix
Analyzed duration differences between Movies and Shows

📊 Visualizations
📅 Yearly content release bar chart
📺 Content type distribution pie chart
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actor-specific filtering (e.g., "Tom Cruise" appearances)
🎭 Genre popularity visual
⏱ Duration analysis visuals

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Tool	Purpose

🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
📊 Data Visualization
🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 String Matching & Filtering
📆 Time-Based Analysis
📈 Business Insight Generation

✅ Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates my ability to extract actionable insights from unstructured entertainment data. It simulates real-world data challenges like missing values and inconsistent formats, and shows how I turn that into:

📈 Insightful visualizations • 🔍 Actor & genre trends • 💼 Content strategy recommendations

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
🎬 Real-world entertainment dataset
🔍 Answers business-relevant questions
📊 Visual-driven insights
💡 Complete workflow: from cleaning to conclusion
🚀 Great example of storytelling through data
